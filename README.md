# OneCareExtractor
Restores data from Microsoft OneCare Backup file

## Installation

Download and run locally... more instructions coming later

## Usage

Need to unzip all relevant folders and change the `ROOT-PATH` vaiable to the appropriate directory containing only the unzipped files.

After running the script - which may take quite a while - you will be left with a reconstructed directory in the `Reconstructed Dir` folder in the root directory defined by `ROOT-PATH`

## TODO
1) Make command line interface
2) Let user select destination folder for reconstructed dir
3) Automatically unzip folders for user
4) Various path name checks to make sure only the zip files are handeled
5) Reconstruct split files and change their file names as needed
